# Reading json and randomly posting content

I wanted to create an "app" that would read in JSON and print out the results randomly based on a randomly generated number. It took me a while to get right, mostly because of the JSON file format. I have it down now. This is my result.

## Next steps ...

I want to add more quotes and a button to run the code instead of having the user reload the page
